It's advisable to review this notice regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>
            <p className="small-par">Information Collection</p>
            <p>We collect information you directly provide to us. This includes details such as when you create a business or consumer account, use our Services to transact in cryptocurrency, access features, seek customer support, or communicate with us. The data we may gather includes your contact information (like email, postal address, phone number), date of birth, username, profile image, payment details, transaction records, and any additional information you choose to share.</p>

            <p>We also automatically collect information when you interact with our Services, such as transaction details and device information (e.g., hardware model, IP address, etc.). Your approximate location may be inferred based on your IP address, and we employ tracking technologies like cookies to enhance our Services and understand usage patterns.</p>
            <p className="small-par">Use of Information</p>
            <p>We utilize the collected information to operate, improve, and maintain our Services.
